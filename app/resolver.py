"""Offline DNS zone resolution logic.

Only A queries are handled. Names are case-insensitive and normalized with a
trailing dot. Wildcard matching follows RFC 1034 semantics: find the closest
encloser (longest existing ancestor, empty non-terminals included) and look
for a ``*`` record directly below it.

Zone delegation: multiple NS records may be placed at any non-apex,
non-wildcard name ("delegation point"). NS targets are normalized to absolute
names and may live outside the zone. A name may not hold NS together with
A/CNAME records and delegations may not nest. The delegation boundary is
checked first, so a query at or below a delegation point yields a REFERRAL
even when an exact A record or an upper wildcard would otherwise match. An A
record at an in-subtree NS target acts as glue; glue is only returned inside a
referral and is never authoritative on its own.
